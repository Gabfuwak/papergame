A (unifinished) 2D combat game inspired by Smash Bros and Hollow knight.

This game was made for a school project at Universit√© Paris-Saclay. This repo is dead and will not be updated in the future. A redo of the game with more suitable tools might be a thing someday though.

It contains a library made by my teacher Kim Nguyen, Gfx ( go check him out he's cool https://usr.lmf.cnrs.fr/~kn/). It is an OCaml basic graphics library that can render to SDL and to web.

Everything else is made by me.

This ended up being more of a game engine than an actual game. It contains ressource management and atlas creation, a custom made ECS using ocaml modules, a state machine for characters, a projectile system, a modular attacking system.
