An (unfinished) 2D combat game inspired by Smash Bros and Hollow Knight.

This game was made for a school project at Université Paris-Saclay. This repo is dead and will not be updated in the future. A remake of the game with more suitable tools (C with raylib?) might happen someday, though.

It contains a library called Gfx, made by my functional programming teacher Kim Nguyễn (go check him out, he's cool: https://usr.lmf.cnrs.fr/~kn/). It is a basic OCaml graphics library that can render to SDL and to web.

Everything else was made by me from scratch.

This ended up being more of a game engine than an actual game. It contains resource management and atlas creation, a custom-made ECS using OCaml modules, a state machine for characters, a projectile system, a modular attacking system, a props system, platforms, collisions with composite hitboxes, and modular animations.

Feel free to take inspiration or reuse the code, but please add a link to this repo.
